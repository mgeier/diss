\chapter{Splines}
\label{sec:splines}

This appendix contains detailed information
about many different types of \emph{splines},
including the ones used in the Audio Scene Description Format (ASDF),
as described in appendix~\ref{sec:asdf}.
The following content is the documentation for the
publicly available Python module \code{splines},
written by the author of this thesis.
At the time of writing,
a verbatim copy of this text
is also available online at
\url{https://splines.readthedocs.io/}.
The online version might be updated in the future, though.

Apart from being potentially improved over time,
it is in fact recommended to read the online version
instead of the printed version, because the online version contains
a lot of animations which could not be included in this print version.

Nearly all of the content of this appendix has been written using
Jupyter notebooks (see \url{https://jupyter.org/}),
all of which can be downloaded from the sub-directory \code{doc/} at
\url{https://github.com/AudioSceneDescriptionFormat/splines/}
for further study and experimentation.
