\chapter{Splines}
\label{sec:splines}

This appendix contains detailed information
about many different types of \emph{splines},
including the ones used in the Audio Scene Description Format (ASDF),
as described in appendix~\ref{sec:asdf}.

The following content is a copy of the documentation for the
publicly available Python module \code{splines},
which is also available online at
\url{https://splines.readthedocs.io/}.
In fact, it is recommended to read the online version
instead of the printed version, because the online version contains
a lot of animations which could not be included in this print version.

Nearly all of the content of this appendix has been written using
Jupyter notebooks (see \url{https://jupyter.org/}),
all of which can be downloaded from the sub-directory \code{doc/} at
\url{https://github.com/AudioSceneDescriptionFormat/splines/}
for further study and experimentation.
