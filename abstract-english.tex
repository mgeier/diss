After a brief historic overview
about \emph{spatial audio reproduction},
the concept of \emph{object-based} audio reproduction is explained
and the need for \emph{spatial audio scenes} is stated.
Several existing formats for describing object-based audio scenes
are reviewed,
with special focus on the description of 
movement of scene objects over time.
A new scene authoring format named
Audio Scene Description Format (ASDF) is presented.
Its description of movement of scene objects
is based on several types of \emph{splines},
which are thoroughly investigated, both for position and for rotation.
Finally, an open-source ASDF library implementation
and two integrations of this library
are presented, which make it possible for everyone to try the ASDF right now.
