Abstract:

> After a brief historic overview
> about *spatial audio reproduction*,
> the concept of *object-based* audio reproduction is explained
> and the need for *spatial audio scenes* is stated.
> Several existing formats for describing object-based audio scenes
> are reviewed,
> with special focus on the description of 
> movement of scene objects over time.
> A new scene authoring format named
> Audio Scene Description Format (ASDF) is presented.
> Its description of movement of scene objects
> is based on several types of *splines*,
> which are thoroughly investigated, both for position and for rotation.
> Finally, an open-source ASDF library implementation
> and two integrations of this library
> are presented, which make it possible for everyone to try the ASDF right now.
